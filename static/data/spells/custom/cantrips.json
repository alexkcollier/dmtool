        "A crackling ball of lightning appears in your hand. The ball of lightning remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The lightning sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.",
        "You can also attack with the ball of lightning, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the ball of lightning at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On hit, the target takes 1d6 lightning damage. Each creature within 5 ft. of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take half damage.",
        "This spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6)."
